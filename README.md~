-- GOALS
--  1 Better for functional (formal verification built-in)
--  3 Establish consensus (may use ethereum for main chain)
--  4 Mining is computation verification
--  5 Constraints: 
      * Physical verification - Constrained by physical laws
      * Functional program friendly
      * Better computation verification (chunkable for verification)
--  6 Quantum logic- secure for post quantum
